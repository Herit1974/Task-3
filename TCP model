# TCP/IP Model 

The **TCP/IP model** is a **four-layer networking framework** developed by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1970s. 
It enables **reliable and standardized communication** between devices over various networks like LANs, WANs, and the internet. 
It simplifies the **seven-layer OSI model** into four key layers, each handling different aspects of data transmission.

## Roles of TCP/IP

- Ensures interoperability between diverse systems and network types.
- Provides **accurate, reliable data delivery** through packet-based transmission and reassembly.
- Enables **global communication** by routing data efficiently.

## Layers of TCP/IP Model

### 1. Application Layer

- Closest to users and applications.
- Supports protocols like **HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP**.
- Manages data formatting, session, and encryption.

### 2. Transport Layer

- Ensures correct and reliable delivery of data.
- Uses:
  - **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) – reliable, connection-oriented.
  - **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) – faster, connectionless.
- Manages **flow control**, **segmentation**, and **reassembly**.

### 3. Internet Layer

- Routes packets using **IP addressing**.
- Uses protocols like:
  - **IP** (Internet Protocol)
  - **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol)
  - **ARP** (Address Resolution Protocol)
- Handles **packet forwarding**, **fragmentation**, and **logical addressing**.

### 4. Network Access Layer

- Interfaces with **physical hardware** (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
- Manages:
  - **MAC addressing**
  - **Framing**
  - **Error detection**
- Includes technologies like **Ethernet**, **Wi-Fi**, etc.
